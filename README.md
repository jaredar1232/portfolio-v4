# Personal Portfolio

##

This is version 4 of my portfolio

- Version 1: Single scrollable page built from create react app
- Version 2: Single page app, with multiple "pages", still built on create react app
- Version 3: Overhauled to Gatsby
  • ChatGPT API integrated with a Vercel server I set up to manage the API between the two
- Verson 4: Overhauled to Next.js
  • Looking into hosting on Vercel, if I do I will migrate the Server into this project
  • Will need to find a new way to manage my contact form as I wont have Netlify contact fields anymore
